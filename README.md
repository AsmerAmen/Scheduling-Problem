# Scheduling-Problem
School scheduling problem- using graph coloring algorithm

## Basic Greedy Coloring Algorithm:
1. Color first vertex with first color.
2. Do following for remaining V-1 vertices.
          a) Consider the currently picked vertex and color it with the 
             lowest numbered color that has not been used on any previously
             colored vertices adjacent to it. If all previously used colors 
             appear on vertices adjacent to v, assign a new color to it.
